Smart Fence Guard for Agricultural Lands
Our project aims to create a Smart Fence Guard system that protects farmland from stray and wild animals using affordable, easily available hardware components. The system uses motion detection and automated alerts to help farmers take quick action and prevent crop damage.

Key Hardware Components:
ESP32 Microcontroller: The central processing unit for our system. It’s widely available, cost-effective, and has built-in Wi-Fi capabilities for future expansion. It handles sensor inputs, controls outputs, and manages communication modules.

PIR Motion Sensors: These sensors detect movement near the farm perimeter. They are inexpensive and simple to integrate, ideal for sensing animals approaching the fence.

Buzzer/Alarm: The system activates a buzzer to scare away animals once movement is detected. This acts as an immediate deterrent that doesn’t require human intervention.

GSM Module (SIM800 or similar): For sending SMS alerts to the farmer’s mobile phone in real time. When the sensors detect intruders, the GSM module automatically sends a notification message, ensuring the farmer stays informed remotely.

LCD Display (16x2): Displays system status such as sensor activity, GSM connectivity, and power levels. This helps in easy debugging and monitoring during demonstrations.

Power Supply and Solar Panel (Optional): The system can run on a rechargeable battery pack. To make it sustainable and practical for remote farms, we can add a small solar panel for continuous power.

Miscellaneous: Wires, resistors, PCBs for mounting, and a protective casing to shield electronics from weather conditions.

How It Works:
Our Smart Fence Guard forms a secure boundary around farmland using PIR motion sensors strategically placed along the fence. These sensors continuously monitor for any animal movements. Once an animal (or any other movement) is detected, the ESP32 triggers the buzzer to produce a loud sound, which helps in scaring the animal away immediately.

Simultaneously, the ESP32 activates the GSM module to send an instant SMS alert to the farmer’s phone, informing them about the breach. This allows remote monitoring so the farmer can quickly check or take further action if needed, even if they are not on-site.

The LCD display continuously provides a live update of system health and alerts, making it easy for anyone to verify functionality at a glance.

Why This Project?
Practical and Scalable: It addresses a real problem faced by farmers—crop loss due to animal intrusion. By automating the detection and alert process, it drastically reduces manual monitoring effort.

Affordable Hardware: All components are cost-effective and readily available in the market, making it feasible to build and deploy even on small farms.

Energy Efficient and Sustainable: Adding solar power support increases the system’s usability in remote locations without reliable electricity.

Effective Demonstration: The project results in a physical prototype with sensors, buzzers, and a live alert system, which can impress judges by showing clear hardware innovation.

Overall, our Smart Fence Guard combines IoT, embedded system design, and sustainable tech to build a practical defense mechanism for agricultural lands. It’s straightforward yet powerful—a perfect fit for a college hackathon aiming to solve real-world problems with technology.
