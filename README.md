Our project is a Smart Fence Guard that uses sensors to detect animals near the farm and immediately sends an SMS alert to the farmer’s phone. This way, the farmer gets real-time updates and can take quick action to protect the crops. It’s a simple but effective hardware solution to reduce crop damage and improve farm security.
